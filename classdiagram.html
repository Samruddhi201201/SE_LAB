      Class diagram is a static diagram. It represents the static view of an
      application. Class diagram is not only used for visualizing, describing,
      and documenting different aspects of a system but also for constructing
      executable code of the software application. Class diagram describes the
      attributes and operations of a class and also the constraints imposed on
      the system. The class diagrams are widely used in the modeling of
      objectoriented systems because they are the only UML diagrams, which can
      be mapped directly with object-oriented languages. Class diagram shows a
      collection of classes, interfaces, associations, collaborations, and
      constraints. It is also known as a structural diagram.
