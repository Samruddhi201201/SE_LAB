      A use case diagram is a graphical depiction of a user's possible
      interactions with a system. A use case diagram shows various use cases and
      different types of users the system has and will often be accompanied by
      other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either
      circles or ellipses. The actors are often shown as stick figures. A use
      case diagram doesn't go into a lot of detailâ€”for example, don't expect it
      to model the order in which steps are performed. Instead, a proper use
      case diagram depicts a high-level overview of the relationship between use
      cases, actors, and systems. Experts recommend that use case diagrams be
      used to supplement a more descriptive textual use case. UML is the
      modeling toolkit that you can use to build your diagrams. Use cases are
      represented with a labeled oval shape. Stick figures represent actors in
      the process, and the actor's participation in the system is modeled with a
      line between the actor and use case. To depict the system boundary, draw a
      box around the use case itself. UML use case diagrams are ideal for:
      Representing the goals of system-user interactions Defining and organizing
      functional requirements in a system Specifying the context and
      requirements of a system Modeling the basic flow of events in a use case.
