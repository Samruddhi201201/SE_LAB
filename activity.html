      An activity diagram is a behavioral diagram i.e. it depicts the behavior
      of a system. An activity diagram portrays the control flow from a start
      point to a finish point showing the various decision paths that exist
      while the activity is being executed. We can depict both sequential
      processing and concurrent processing of activities using an activity
      diagram. They are used in business and process modelling where their
      primary use is to depict the dynamic aspects of a system. An activity
      diagram is very similar to a flowchart.
