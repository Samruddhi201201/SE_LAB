      A data flow diagram (DFD) maps out the flow of information for any process
      or system. It uses defined symbols like rectangles, circles and arrows,
      plus short text labels, to show data inputs, outputs, storage points and
      the routes between each destination. Data flowcharts can range from
      simple, even hand-drawn process overviews, to in-depth, multi-level DFDs
      that dig progressively deeper into how the data is handled. They can be
      used to analyze an existing system or model a new one. Like all the best
      diagrams and charts, a DFD can often visually “say” things that would be
      hard to explain in words, and they work for both technical and
      nontechnical audiences, from developer to CEO. That's why DFDs remain so
      popular after all these years. While they work well for data flow software
      and systems, they are less applicable nowadays to visualizing interactive,
      real-time or database-oriented software or systems.
