    <p>
      A state diagram is used to represent the condition of the system or part
      of the system at finite instances of time. It’s a behavioral diagram and
      it represents the behavior using finite state transitions. State diagrams
      are also referred to as State machines and State-chart Diagrams. These
      terms are often used interchangeably. So simply, a state diagram is used
      to model the dynamic behavior of a class in response to time and changing
      external stimuli. We can say that each and every class has a state but we
      don’t model every class using State diagrams. We prefer to model the
      states with three or more states.

      Uses of statechart diagram :–
      <li>
        We use it to state the events responsible for change in state (we do not
        show what processes cause those events)
      </li>
      <li>We use it to model the dynamic behavior of the system. <br /></li>
      <li>
        To understand the reaction of objects/classes to internal or external
        stimuli.
